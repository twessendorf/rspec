<p>No member function can be invoked on a const-qualified object unless the member function is declared "const".</p>

<p>Qualifying member functions that don&#8217;t mutate their object with the "const" qualifier makes your interface easier to understand; you can deduce without diving into implementation if a member function is going to mutate its object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, const-qualified member functions make working with const-qualified objects possible. The compiler ensures that only member functions that are declared "const" can be invoked on "const" objects. Avoiding declaring non-mutating member functions const might breakÂ const-correctness: it will not be possible to invoke such non-mutating functions on const-qualified objects.</p>
