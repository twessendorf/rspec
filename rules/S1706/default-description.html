<p>While exceptions are a common feature of modern languages, there are several reasons to potentially avoid them:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>They make the control flow of a program difficult to understand, because they introduce additional exit points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of exceptions in new code can make that code difficult to integrate with existing, non-exception-safe code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They add to the size of each binary produced, thereby increasing both compile time and final executable size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They may incur a small performance penalty.</p>

<p>No, we&#8217;re not going to check anything related to noexcept (in this rule).  No longer. Current implementation flags <code>noexcept</code> as a violation, which is wrong: even if <code>noexcept</code> is something related to exceptions, it is valid to use it in a context where exception are forbidden.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s clearer [~loic.joly]. Also, it&#8217;s not immediately clear to me why catching the exceptions from the code someone else wrote that I&#8217;m forced to use would raise an issue. A little expansion on that topic might be helpful.</p>

<p>From what I&#8217;ve seen from people who want to avoid exceptions, it&#8217;s not that they want to avoid them in their code, they want to avoid them in the whole program (even disabling exception support in the compiler). If they use external code that might throw:</p>

<p>Either they make sure to use it only in way that won&#8217;t trigger an exception (just a subset of the API, or manually checking some stuff <em>before</em> calling throwing functions)</p>
