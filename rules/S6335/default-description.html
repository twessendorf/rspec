<p>Google Cloud service accounts are designed to authenticate and authorize requests to Google APIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your application interacts with Google Cloud services then it requires a service account to access all the resources it needs to function properly. Resources that can be accessed depend on the permission granted to the service account. Establishing the identity of a service account relies on a public/private key pair. It&#8217;s common for private keys to be distributed through a JSON file that your application will then use to consume Google APIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A key may authenticate to a high privilege which has unrestricted access to all resources in your Google Cloud project, including billing information.</p>

<p>Only administrators should have access to the service account key used by your application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a consequence, service account keys should not be stored along with the application code as they would grant special privileges to anyone who has access to the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keys should be stored outside of the code in a file that is never committed to your application code repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If possible, a better alternative is to use your cloud provider&#8217;s service for managing secrets. On Google Cloud this service is called <a href="https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager">Secret Manager</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When keys are disclosed in the application code, consider them as compromised and revoke them immediately.</p>
