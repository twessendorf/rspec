<p>I think the emphasis of this rule was itself confused. The title addressed the <code>Runnable</code> but the description was about the class that created an instance of a vacuous <code>Runnable</code>. I&#8217;ve updated the description and code samples to move the emphasis to the empty <code>Runnable</code>. Please let me know if you feel changes are still needed.</p>

<p>In term of separation of concerns, the second approach is definitely the best one. Moreover with this second approach it&#8217;s simply impossible to forget to implement the run() method whereas when extending the Thread class, nothing compel you to override the Thread.run() method.</p>
