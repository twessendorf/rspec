<p>Using <code>DISTINCT</code> in SQL <code>SELECT</code> statements should be avoided. Not only is this command to remove duplicates not efficient, but a <code>SELECT DISTINCT</code> query indicates that something is not quite right. That is because using the <code>DISTINCT</code> keyword means that redundant data is being pulled from the database and then discarded.</p>
