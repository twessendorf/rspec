<p><code>DO</code> blocks that contain too many lines are difficult to read and understand.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor the contents of the <code>DO</code> block into multiple, well-named subroutines or subfunctions, each of which focuses on a well-defined task. Those smaller subroutines will not only be easier to understand, but probably also easier to test.</p>
