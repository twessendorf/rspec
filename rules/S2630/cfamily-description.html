<p>Far from being quick and efficient, regular expression evaluation can lead to an exponential number of evaluation paths in the worst case. Use a vulnerable regular expression, and with the right inputs it could bring your system to its knees, resulting in a Denial of Service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Specifically, a vulnerable regex is one that contains a repeated group (E.G. <code>(x)*</code> ), and inside that group there is either further repetition or overlapping alternation (E.G. <code>ab|aba</code> ).</p>
