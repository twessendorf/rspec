<p>A global variable can be modified from anywhere in the program. At first, this might look convenient, but in fact, it makes programs very hard to understand: When you see a function call, you cannot know if the function will affect the value of the variable or not. You have lost the ability to reason locally about your code and must always have the whole program in mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, in multi-threaded environments, global variables are often subject to race conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some global variables defined in external libraries (such as <code>std::cout</code>, <code>std::cin</code>, <code>std::cerr</code>) are fine to use, but you should have a good reason to create your own. If you do use a global variable make sure that they can be safely accessed concurrently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This rule detects all declarations of global variables (in the global namespace or in any namespace) that are not constant.</p>

<p>\[~geoffray.adde], [~loic.joly] this seems remarkably similar to RSPEC-1902 to me. And related to RSPEC-997. I suggest this be made a subtask of RSPEC-1902.</p>

<p>Also Geoffray, the Exceptions section should come after the code samples, and the text of an exception should describe (only) when and issue would normally be expected but will not be raised. This exception text is broader than that. The second sentence should be relocated into the description and the first should probably be sharpened from "are fine to use" to "will be ignored".</p>

<p>\[~loic.joly] if it truly "has nothing in common with the main task" then there is no advantage. But I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the case. In this instance, what I see is two currently-independent rules that deal with "global variables Bad!" and it makes sense to me to centralize that theme under one RSpec. In terms of the rule id, it should always be that of the top-level spec, so I don&#8217;t understand how anything would be hidden. I also don&#8217;t understand what disadvantages you see from the RuleAPI side.</p>

<p>When I said the rule ID is hidden, I meant it&#8217;s not displayed in rules.sonarsource.com, and is not displayed visibly in the UI for sonarqube. From a user perspective, the only element that links the rule for C&#43;&#43; and the rule for RPG is the ruleId that we don&#8217;t want out users to use. This is why I don&#8217;t understand the benefits of this added complexity.</p>
