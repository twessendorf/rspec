<p>The worst nightmare of every COBOL maintenance programmer is a program where you have to follow 12 concatenated <code>PERFORM</code> statements before you get to the actual processing. This is considered to be the <code>GOTO</code>-less version of spaghetti programming.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This situation can be avoided by having a mainline procedure at the beginning of the procedure division which concentrates all program control, and which reads like a map of the program. This mainline procedure should be free from detailed operations such as moving fields, calculations, I/O operations, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This rule helps ensure that most program control is concentrated in the mainline procedure (the first one in the program) by preventing the other procedures from having more than a predefined threshold of "PERFORM" statements.</p>

<p>This rule is currently "related to" RSPEC-1286, but should instead be dependent upon it (or rather it&#8217;s implementation should be dependent on the implentation of RSPEC-1286), since the description of this one needs to reference the as-yet-unassigned(?) key of RSPEC-1286&#8217;s implementation</p>
