<p>Multicharacter literals have <code>int</code> type and have an implementation-defined value. This means they might be interpreted differently by different compilers. For example, they might lead to different behavior when compiled with GCC than when compiled with MSVC.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if they work as you expect with a specific compiler, they will make your code less portable. They are also misleading as they look like strings, hence make your code less readable.</p>
