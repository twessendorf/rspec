<p>The <code>PROGRAM-ID</code> declaration at the top of a program must exactly match the filename of the program. If these do not match, functions like <code>CANCEL</code> may not be able to cancel the program, leaving it resident in memory. Debugging can also be affected because program breakpoints may not match the program name.</p>
