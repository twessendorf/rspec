<p>Just as comparing apples and oranges is seen as a classic folly, comparing values from different enumerations against each other or converting them into one another is nonsensical. True, at root <code>enum</code>s are simply named numbers, and it&#8217;s certainly valid to compare numbers. But an added layer of meaning is created by an <code>enum</code>, one that goes beyond simple numerical values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ignoring that extra layer of meaning is at best a trap for maintainers, who are likely to be hopelessly confused by the code. At worst, it is a bug, which will lead to unexpected results.</p>
