<p>Using the output of a non-boolean assignment as a condition is highly suspicious. Either it was done accidentally, and the assignment operator <code>=</code> was used in place of the equality operator <code>==</code>, or it was done with the intent to rely on the automatic conversion of the non-boolean value to a boolean, which could be confusing for maintainers.</p>

<p>Before C99, the C language didn&#8217;t have any boolean type so applying this rule on C might raise a lot of false-positives.</p>
