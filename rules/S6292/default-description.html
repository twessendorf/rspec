<p>Amazon Marketplace Web Service credentials are designed to authenticate and authorize Amazon sellers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your application interacts with Amazon MWS then it requires credentials to access all the resources it needs to function properly. The credentials authenticate to a seller account which can have access to resources like products, orders, price or shipment information.</p>

<p>Only administrators should have access to the MWS credentials used by your application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a consequence, MWS credentials should not be stored along with the application code as they would grant special privilege to anyone who has access to the application source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Credentials should be stored outside of the code in a file that is never committed to your application code repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If possible, a better alternative is to use your cloud provider&#8217;s service for managing secrets. On AWS this service is called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fr/secrets-manager/">Secrets Manager</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When credentials are disclosed in the application code, consider them as compromised and revoke them immediately.</p>
