<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since integers are usually represented in binary form in computers, it is efficient to check if a given number is a power of two by checking if its  <code>unsigned</code> representation has a single bit set.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In C&#43;&#43; such check could be expressed as <code>x &amp; (x-1) == 0</code>. However, the intent of this expression is unclear. Furthermore, it requires to take special care for the value <code>0</code>, which would pass the above check, while not having any bit set and not being a power of two.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This check can be expressed more clearly with the <code>std::has_single_bit</code> function template, introduced in C&#43;&#43;20.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This rule reports computations that could be replaced with <code>std::has_single_bit</code> .</p>
