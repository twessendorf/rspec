<p>Inheritance is certainly one of the most valuable concepts in object-oriented programming. It&#8217;s a way to compartmentalize and reuse code by creating collections of attributes and behaviors called classes which can be based on previously created classes. But abusing this concept by creating a deep inheritance tree can lead to very complex and unmaintainable source code. Most of the time a too deep inheritance tree is due to bad object oriented design which has led to systematically use 'inheritance' when for instance 'composition' would suit better.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This rule raises an issue when the inheritance tree, starting from <code>Object</code> has a greater depth than is allowed.</p>
