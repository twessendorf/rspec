<p><code>volatile</code> can be used to qualify many objects in C and C&#43;&#43;, but only a few of the possible places have a well-defined meaning (global variables and local variables for instance).
There is no well-defined meaning to the use of volatile to qualify a function return type or a function parameter.
Furthermore, for structured bindings, the volatile qualifier appertains to the decomposed object which cannot be referred to.
Since C&#43;&#43;20, these uses are deprecated, but even before you should not use volatile in those places.</p>

<p>This rule raises an issue for a volatile qualified function return type, function parameter, and structured binding (available in C&#43;&#43; since C&#43;&#43;17).</p>
